# cme WordWrapper

## caught my eye Custom Word Wrapper Plugin

Customise how your page title will word wrap. 

This WordPress plugin allows you to decide where a long page title will wrap (break) on smaller devices.

**Example**: We can insert a line break in ThisIsAReallyLongWord to display it like `ThisIsAReally<br>LongWord` instead. This means your long page titles will fit on a mobile device without being cutoff.
